Test 1 - Thread yield from Lecture - tests basic yielding and thred switching for 2 threads
Test 2 - Yield from lab - tests basic yielding and thred switching for 3 threads

Test 3 - brawl stars - handles locking and unlocking, as well as simple ordering for 3 threads. Doesnt use cv or waits, but yields instead
Test 4 - from the spec (expected output provided) - handles more complicated locking, unlocking, and ordering for 2 threads. Also uses yield and no cv's

Test 5 - Ping Pong Lab - tests basic functionality and cv, using one cv and 2 threads, as well as signal. Ping Pong from lab
Test 6 - Call Center Lab - is more complicated functionality and multiple cvs - tests wait and signal, but not broadcast. 
Test 7 - Piano Lab - Signals more deterministic, only for the piano keys written in the string, tests wait and signal as well
